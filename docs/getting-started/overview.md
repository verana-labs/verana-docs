# Getting Started with Verana

The Verana blockchain provides multiple ways to get started based on your use case. This guide will walk you through the following options:

1. **Run an Isolated Local Node**  
   Set up a standalone local development environment to test and experiment without connecting to other networks.

2. **Use Remote CLI**  
   Interact with existing networks (`vna-testnet-1` or `vna-mainnet-1`) using CLI commands remotely.

3. **Run a Local Node That Joins a Network**  
   Set up a local node that connects to `vna-testnet-1` or `vna-mainnet-1` to participate in the network.

Each section provides step-by-step instructions to get you started!
