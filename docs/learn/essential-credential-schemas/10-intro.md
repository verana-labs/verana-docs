# Introduction

**Essential Credential Schemas (ECSs)** are the Verifiable Trust basic needed schemas for **enabling a minimum trust resolution** in Services and User Agents by answering these questions:

- who is the provider of this Verifiable Service?
- what is the minimum age required to access this Verifiable Service?
- is the User Agent trying to connect to a Verifiable Service a Verifiable User Agent?
- ...

**The Verana Foundation** created a defined an Ecosystem Governance Framework and created a Trust Registry in the Verana Verifiable Trust Network (VVTN) for providing Essential Credential Schemas (ECS) to the community. There are 4 kinds of ECS:

- Service;
- Organization;
- Person;
- UserAgent.

Service schema is `OPEN` to anyone. Participants that want to obtain an Organization, Person, or UserAgent Verifiable Trust Credential (VTC) must contact an authorized issuer and perform a validation process in order to obtain their credential.

Remember the popup presented by a Verifiable Service: in this example you can see that information comes from Organization and Service Verifiable Trust Credentials (VTCs).
