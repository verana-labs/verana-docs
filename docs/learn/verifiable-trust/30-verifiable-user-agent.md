# Verifiable User Agent

A Verifiable User Agent (VUA) is software, such as a browser, app, or wallet, designed to connect with Verifiable Services (VS) and other VUAs. When establishing connections, a VUA must verify the identity and trustworthiness of its peers and allow connections only to compliant VS or VUA peers.

As part of this process, the VUA must perform trust resolution by:

- Verifying the Verifiable Credentials presented by the peers
- Querying Verifiable Public Registries (VPRs) to confirm that these credentials were issued by recognized and authorized issuers.

This ensures that all connections are based on verifiable trust, not assumptions.
