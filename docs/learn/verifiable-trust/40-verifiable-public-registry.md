# Verifiable Public Registry

A **Verifiable Public Registry (VPR)** is a **“registry of registries”**, a public service that provides foundational infrastructure for decentralized trust ecosystems.

The **Verana Verifiable Trust Network** is an *implementation* of a Verifiable Public Registry.

A VPR offers:

- **Trust Registry Management**:  
  Ecosystems can create and manage their own **Trust Registries**, each with:
  - Defined **Credential Schemas**
  - Assigned roles for **Issuers**, **Verifiers**, and **Grantors** (Trust Registry Operators)
  - Custom **business models** and permission policies

- **Query API for Trust Resolution**:  
  A standardized API used by **Verifiable Services (VSs)** and **Verifiable User Agents (VUAs)** to perform trust resolution, enabling them to query registry data and validate roles and permissions in real time. Query API must include support for the [TRQP](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-trust-registry-protocol/).

package "Verifiable Public Registry" as vpr {

    object "Trust Registry of Ecosystem #A" as tra #3fbdb6 {
    }

    object "Trust Registry of Ecosystem #B" as trb #3fbdb6 {

    }

    object "Trust Registry of Ecosystem #C" as trc #3fbdb6 {

    }

    object "Trust Registry of Ecosystem #E" as tre #3fbdb6 {

    }
    
   
}

#### Trust Registries

*This section is non-normative.*

Each **Trust Registry** must provide, at a minimum:

- an Ecosystem controlled **resolvable DID**
- One or more **Governance Framework** document(s)
- Zero or more **Credential Schemas**

The **Verifiable Public Registry (VPR)** is agnostic to the specific **DID methods** used. Trust resolution is performed externally, outside the VPR, allowing flexibility and interoperability across ecosystems.

```plantuml

@startuml
scale max 800 width
 
object "Trust Registry" as tra #3fbdb6 {
    ecosystem did
    ecosystem credential schemas
    ecosystem governance framework docs
}

```

### Credential Schemas and Permissions

[[ref: Credential schemas]] are created and managed by trust registry controller **ecosystems**. Each **credential schema** includes, at a minimum:

- A **JSON Schema** that defines the structure of the corresponding **verifiable credential**
- A **PermissionManagementMode** for **issuance policy**, which determines how `ISSUER` permissions are granted. Modes include:
  - `OPEN`: `ISSUER` permissions can be created by anyone.
  - `ECOSYSTEM`: `ISSUER` permissions are granted directly by the **ecosystem**, the trust registry controller
  - `GRANTOR`: `ISSUER` permissions are granted by one or several issuer grantor(s) (trust registry operator(s) responsible for selecting issuers for the credential schema of this **ecosystem**), selected by the **ecosystem**.
- A **PermissionManagementMode** for **verification policy**, which determines how `VERIFIER` permissions are granted. Modes include:
  - `OPEN`: `VERIFIER` permissions can be created by anyone.
  - `ECOSYSTEM`: `VERIFIER` permissions are granted directly by the **ecosystem**, the Trust Registry controller
  - `GRANTOR`: `VERIFIER` permissions are granted by one or several verifier grantor(s) (trust registry operator(s) responsible for selecting verifiers for the credential schema of this **ecosystem**), selected by the **ecosystem**.
- A **Permission tree** that defines the roles and relationships involved in managing the schema’s lifecycle. Each created permission in the tree can define business rules, see below Business Models.

```plantuml

@startuml
scale max 800 width
 
package "Example Credential Schema Permission Tree" as cs {

    object "Ecosystem A" as tr #3fbdb6 {
        permissionType: ECOSYSTEM (Root)
        did:example:ecosystemA
    }
    object "Issuer Grantor B" as ig {
        permissionType: ISSUER_GRANTOR
        did:example:igB
    }
    object "Issuer C" as issuer #7677ed  {
        permissionType: ISSUER
        did:example:iC
    }
    object "Verifier Grantor D" as vg {
        permissionType: VERIFIER_GRANTOR
        did:example:vgD
    }
    object "Verifier E" as verifier #00b0f0 {
        permissionType: VERIFIER
        did:example:vE
    }

    object "Holder Z " as holder #FFB073 {
        permissionType: HOLDER
    }
}



tr --> ig : granted schema permission
ig --> issuer : granted schema permission

tr --> vg : granted schema permission
vg --> verifier : granted schema permission

issuer --> holder: granted schema permission

Participant roles are defined in the table below:

| **Participant Role**   | **Description**                                                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ecosystem**    | Create and control trust registries and credential Schemas. Recognize other participants by granting permission(s) to them.        |
| **Issuer Grantor**    | Trust Registry operator that grants Issuer permissions to candidate issuers.                   |
| **Verifier Grantor**  | Trust Registry operator that grants Verifier permissions to candidate verifiers.               |
| **Issuer**            | Can issue credentials of this schema.                            |
| **Verifier**          | Can request presentation of credentials of this schema.          |
| **Holder**            | Holds a credential.   |

Example of a Json Schema credential schema:

  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "credentialSubject": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": {

        },
        "lastName": {
