# What is Verana?

Verana is an open initiative creating a **decentralized trust layer for the Internet**.
It is built on [verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/), [DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/), and public permissionless trust registries.

Verana enables transparent, verifiable interactions across digital services and ecosystems.

It empowers users with self-sovereign identity and user-centric privacy.

**Ecosystems** use the **Verana Verifiable Trust Network** to create trust registries and govern **who can issue, verify, and hold credentials**. Network supports **privacy-preserving monetization** where all ecosystem participants are **rewarded**.

**Verifiable Services**, **Verifiable AI Agents** and **Verifiable User Agents** prove their identity and governance.

## Don't trust. Verify

Verana is defined by the [Verifiable Trust](https://verana-labs.github.io/verifiable-trust-spec/[) and [Verifiable Public Registry](https://verana-labs.github.io/verifiable-trust-vpr-spec/) specs.

It fosters a re-decentralized Internet, moving from implicit trust to **verifiable trust**.
