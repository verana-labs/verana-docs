# Introduction

We learnt in the [learn section](../../learn/verifiable-trust/00-introduction.md) that verifiable service (VS) is a service, uniquely identified by a [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/), that can authenticate itself to a peer by presenting [verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) before any connection is initiated.

Building a VS is as easy as embedding the [vs-agent container](https://github.com/2060-io/vs-agent) in your service.
