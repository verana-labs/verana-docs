# User Agent Credentials

Once your agent is certified, it is considered a Verifiable User Agent (VUA), and you obtain an ISSUER permission of a User Agent Credential Schema of an ECS Ecosystem.

You can now issue User Agent Credential to your VUA instances. Instances must store the credential and present this credential to Verifiable Services or other VUA instances (that not necessarily are instances from the same VUA), as specified in the [Verifiable Trust spec](https://verana-labs.github.io/verifiable-trust-spec/).
