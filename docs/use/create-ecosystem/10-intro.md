# Create an Ecosystem

Create an Ecosystem means:

- willing to create one or several Credential Schemas, and govern how participants will be able to join your Ecosystem as trust registry operators, issuers, verifiers,...;
- publishing an Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF) that defines Ecosystem rules, what are the Credential Schemas, who can and how to join the Ecosystem,...;

make sure to learn the basis by reading the [Learn section](../../learn/verifiable-public-registry/trust-registries).
